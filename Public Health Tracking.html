<h1>Environmental Public Health Tracking Network</h1>
<p>Local health departments have a number of resources 
available to gain an understanding of the community in 
which it serves, however, sometimes the data and the 
numbers just aren’t available. When it comes time to 
decide ways to ensure a community is thriving and healthy, 
it is important to find those numbers and data so the 
department can address the most pressing issues first.

The partnership between NEHA and the CDC is creating a 
solution that many local health departments face when it 
comes to lacking data.  The Environmental Public Health 
Tracking network is a collection of data from environmental 
hazards to human health effects surveillance. With 26 state 
and local health departments already providing their data to 
the over-arching network, it is already seeing an increase in 
use.</p>

<h2>Environmental Tracking for Public Health Surveillance</h2>
<p>Satellite imagery and data are widely used in public health 
surveillance to provide early warning of disease outbreaks and 
for averting pandemics. Convergence of these technologies began 
in the 1970s and has gained wide acceptance in the 21st Century.

Environmental Tracking for Public Health Surveillance focuses on 
the expanding use of satellite sensor imagery and long-term 
spectral measurements for assessing and modelling Earth’s 
environments in context of public health surveillance. It 
addresses vector-borne, air-borne, water-borne, and zoonotic 
diseases, and explores analytical methods for forecasting 
environmental conditions and their potential for consequent disease 
outbreaks. Infectious and contagious diseases are of particular 
interest in this volume because once parasite-vector-human host 
pathways are triggered by favourable biological circumstances, 
pandemic diseases can spread to global scale in a matter of hours. 
The chapters advance readers through three sets of material. Part I 
reviews the 1970-2012 history of satellite Earth-science surveillance 
technology that led to linking natural environments to human diseases, 
and more generally to public health applications.

<h3>Environmental Policy and Public Health</h3>
<p>As with the first edition, this second edition describes how 
environmental health policies are developed, the statutes and other 
policies that have evolved to address public health concerns associated 
with specific environmental hazards, and the public health foundations 
of the policies. It lays out policies for what is considered the major 
environmental physical hazards to human health. Specifically, the authors 
describe hazards from air, water, food, hazardous substances, and wastes. 
To this list the authors have added the additional concerns from climate 
change, tobacco products, genetically-modified organisms, environment-
related diseases, energy production, biodiversity and species endangerment, 
and the built environment. And as with the first edition, histories of 
policymaking for specific environmental hazards are portrayed. This edition 
differs from its antecedent in three significant themes. Global perspectives 
are added to chapters that describe specific environmental hazards, e.g., 
air pollution policies in China and India. Also there is the material on the 
consequences of environmental hazards on both human and ecosystem health. 
Additionally readers are provided with information about interventions that 
policymakers and individuals can consider in mitigating or preventing specific 
environmental hazards.
